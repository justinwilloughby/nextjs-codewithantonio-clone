## Purpose
I've been interested in nextjs recently and codewithantonio on Youtube has been a great resource to learn. He builds out a lot of full stack clones like Miro, Duolingo, Twitch etc. I'm new to nextjs and this cloning technique seems like a great learning tool so I decided to mock up his landing page. There's no backend functionality, it's just the landing page. I learned a lot about page layouts an tailwind css.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
